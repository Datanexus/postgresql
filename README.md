    type: SIZE
Replace SIZE with the size of the root or data volume in GB, e.g, `20` for 20gig or `2000` for 2TB. `11` is a reasonable value for the root volume.

Replace POOL with any configured block pool, e.g., ScaleIO or Ceph.

## deployment
### amazon web services
To deploy on AWS (approximately 12 minutes for a standalone)

    ./deploy aws

Expected running times:

* standlone approximately 12 minutes 
* master/replica approximately 19 minutes

### openstack
To deploy on OSP:
  
    ./deploy osp

Expected running times:

* standlone approximately 12 minutes 
* master/replica approximately 16 minutes

## testing
If the `deploy` code ran without errors, that's a pretty good indicator of a successful deployment. However, you can run the following to be sure.

### amazon web services
To test an AWS deployment:

    ./test aws

### openstack
To test an OSP deployment:
  
    ./test osp
        
### expected results
Depending on your configuration (standalone vs replica), you will see various skipped plays, this is normal. Ignore the majority of the output until the end when you'll see the following:

     "msg": [
            "SELECT 500"
        ]

This indicates the `t_random` table was successfully created on the standalone or master. If you've also created a replica, look for something similar that follows:

    "msg": [
            " s  |               md5                ",
            "----+----------------------------------",
            "  1 | a5b6eb6b8f14a2a4df2df955031f2ba7",
            "  2 | 0a40ce5c1f2065dabf1cf0c1b7aa8979",
            "  3 | 66fc054c33e17c8f68c721685db3cc6e",
            "  4 | b562fa0f98a6b078bf33c1772d9e5370",
            "  5 | bd8324ae639812ba9efa09be91b5c5cb",
            "  6 | 9dd06419a085b55557f7e9ccdf7f152a",
            "  7 | 202b558c6dde99b40e4dedb7542ed4e5",
            "  8 | 0048168d4601c71d53846d38a9a80611",
            "  9 | a51e388950257283c7fe62508fdfb299",
            " 10 | a9814e339e7f93c1fab22c808844dc13",
            " 11 | 653aded1ffb1a1c6276f5d6426306496",
            " 12 | c828adde266bdec9963f83bccdaf731f",
            " 13 | 14c3e9a03cb6e33676bdfe9a4dd143c0",
            " 14 | 895db8a45c71134009da8e1095c857db",
            " 15 | 9710d6a6f894355520dcd329ce761c89",
            "(15 rows)"
        ]

This shows the select was successfully run on the replica, indicating a successful deployment. Next, you'll see:

    "msg": [
            "DROP TABLE"
        ]
        
This shows the successful  removal of the test `t_random` table from the standalone (or master which will also stream the removal to the replica).
